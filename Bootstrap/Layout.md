# Containers

Containers are the most fundamental Bootstrap layout element and are necessary when utilising our default grid system. Select between a responsive, fixed-width container (whose maximum width changes at each breakpoint) and a fluid-width container (which is always 100% wide).
While containers can be nested, they are not required in most layouts.
