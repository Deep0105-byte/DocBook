Bootstrap is a set of free and open-source tools for building responsive websites and online apps. 
It is the most widely used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating mobile-first, responsive websites. 
It resolves numerous issues that we previously encountered, one of which being the cross-browser compatibility issue. 
Currently, webpages are optimised for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and screen sizes (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). 
All credit to Twitter's Bootstrap creators, Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton, however it was later designated an open-source project. 
Bootstrap has multiple versions, and each time we want to utilise this framework, we may choose the version we want to use.

# Why Bootstrap? 
Faster and Easier Web Development.
It creates Platform-independent web pages.
It creates Responsive Web-pages.
It is designed to be responsive to mobile devices too.
It is Free! Available on www.getbootstrap.com
