# Values and Variables

## Values

A value is just a piece of data, most fundamental unit of information in programming.

<code> let name="John"</code>

In the above we declared a variable which will be created in computer's memory and assigned a value to it "John".

## Naming convention for variables

1. When a variable consists of multiple name then the first letter of the first word variable must be a small letter i.e., camel case, and all the subsequent words first letter will be a capital letter.
   > Camel case is preferred mostly in javascript but you can also use snake case.
2. If variable starts with number then it will be a illegal variable.
   e.g.: <code>let 20year=20 //error</code>
3. A variable name can contain only numbers, letters,underscores or dollar signs.
4. A variable cannot be named after a reserved javascript keyword.
   e.g.: <code>let function=10 //output: error</code>

   > If programmer want to name it after reserved keywords then the programmer cant start the variable name with underscore or keyword. So this is allowed **let \_function=10** or this **$function=10**
   >
   > But is is recommended to never name your variables after reserved keywords.

5. Never start your variables name with a uppercase letter.It is just a convention not illegal.
   > variables that are all in upper case are constants like PI, etc.
6. Variables name should be descriptive so that it is easier to read them.
