# Arrow function

This type of function was added in ES6, and is a shorter and faster way to write a function.

e.g.: <code>
const add=(a,b)=>{return a + b;};

console.log(add(2,3)) //output: 5

</code>

In the above example, you can observe that an arrow is used to defined a function and the function then stored in a variable.

We can also write this in much more simplified way.

<code>
const add=(a,b)=>a+b;
</code>

In the above code, parentheses and curly brackets are omitted and the return keyword is added by javascript internally to return **a+b**. It will work the same way as that of previous example if invoked.

> Arrow function are extremely helpful to write one-liner functions.

> It complicated to choose if you want to write arrow function for all function declaration due to keyword **this**(we will see this later).
