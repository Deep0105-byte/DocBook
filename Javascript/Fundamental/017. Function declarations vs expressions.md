# Function declarations and expression

They are two ways to define and declare a function(There is also a third one,we will see it later).

We have already seen function declaration in the previous article. Let's look at function expression

e.g.: <code>
const add=function(a,b){
return a+b
}

console.log(add(a,b))

</code>

In the above example, we have observed that a variable **add** is declared and defined as function and call it in a same way as a function declaration.

You may have doubt then what is the use of function expression, sometimes you have to write a anonymous function is some part of your codebase. Then what is an anonymous function, it a function without any name. In the above example, after **const add=** a function is defined without any name and add is the name later given to it, but before it was an anonymous function.

> In javascript, function is not a type but just a value like numbers, strings, etc.

---

>In javascript, a function can be **called** before it is **defined**(we will see it later articles why this occurs).
>
>It upon your preference which way you want to define functions.
