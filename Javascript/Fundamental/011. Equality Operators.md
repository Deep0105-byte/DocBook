# Equality operators

Javascript has two equality operators **==** and **===** and their not equal counterpart.

## What is the difference between both of them

***===*** is a strict equality operator and does not perform type coercion when performed whereas **==** does that. **==** is know as loose equality operator.

<code> console.log(2=='2') //output: true <br/> console.log(2==='2') //output: false</code>

In the above example, the loose equality operator will convert the data type of values to perform equality comparisons where strict will not do that.

>It is recommended to avoid ***loose*** equality operator as much as you can. In real life, try to covert the data type manually or explicitly before comparing them. Always try to use ***strict*** equality operator.
>
>!= and !== are the counterpart of equality operators. They are also known as different operators.
