# Objects

It is a data structure.But unlike array, objects contain key-value pairs. Mostly created using curly braces.

e.g.: <code>

const john={
age:25,
city:"New York",
job:"Developer",
friends:["Harry","Sally"]
}

</code>

> Each key is also called a property.

> Rule of thumb, you can use array for more ordered data and object for more unstructured data.

## Dot vs Bracket notation

To access objects properties we use either the dot notation or brackets notation. But there is a key difference between both of them.

### Let's look first at the bracket notation

e.g. <code>

const john={
age:25,
city:"New York",
job:"Developer",
friends:["Harry","Sally"]
}

console.log(john['city']) //output: "New York"

</code>

As observed above, the bracket notation takes a **key** value inside a bracket attached to the object.

> Bracket notation supports the expression, so we can write a template literal, operations,etc. Therefore we can write computed property name. It is also known as computed member access.

### Now for dot notation

e.g. <code>

const john={
age:25,
city:"New York",
job:"Developer",
friends:["Harry","Sally"]
}

console.log(john.city) //output: "New York"
</code>

> A rule of thumb is when you want to use the computed properties name so use bracket notation else dot notation since it is much easier to write and looks clean. It is simply knows as member access.

Let's suppose a property does exist in the object and we want to access it by taking an input from user.

e.g.: <code>

const interests=prompt("Enter your interests.")

console.log(john.job) //output:undefined
console.log\*(john.job) //output:"Developer"

</code>

As seen above, the dot notation will return **undefined** means the property does not exist in the object but a bracket notation will return the computed property and return its value.

This is how we retrieve elements from the object.

### Adding a property to the object

e.g.: <code>

john.location="USA"
john["location"]="USA"

</code>

> **NOTE:** Dot notation has higher precedence than Bracket notation. For more details see this documentation [Operator Precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).
