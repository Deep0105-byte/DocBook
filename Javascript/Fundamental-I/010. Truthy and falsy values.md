# Truthy and falsy values

## Falsy

This are the values that are not exactly false but becomes when we covert them to a boolean.

Their are five falsy values in javascript:

1. null
2. undefined
3. '' (empty string)
4. 0
5. NaN

Expect this all are truthy values in javascript.

Just like number and string **Boolean** is used to covert them.
<code>console.log(Boolean(undefined)) //output: false</code>

> But in real life, the conversion to falsy values in implicit (i.e., type coercion). It happens in two scenarios when using logical operators or logical statements like **if/else**.
