# Ternary Operator

It is like a shorthand for if/else statement.

e.g.: <code> let age=20<br/> age===20?"You are 20 years old":"You are not 20 years old."</code>

**'?'** is a conditional operator which evaluates the boolean operation on its left, if it is true then the statement before **':'** executes otherwise statement after **':'** executes.

>**NOTE:** Ternary operator is an expression so we can use it to assign values to a variable.
> We can also use it in template literal since it returns a value.
