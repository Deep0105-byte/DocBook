# String and template literals

Strings are the important data type of not just javascript but many programming languages.

e.g.: <code>let name="John" <br/> console.log("I am "+ name) //output: "I am John"</code>

# Template literals

Using this we can write a string in normal way and insert the variable in it.

e.g.: <code>console.log(`I am ${name}`) //output: I am John</code>

The string literals are written inside backticks( **`** ).

> So in javascript we have three ways to write a string, inside a single quote, inside a double quote and inside a backticks.

Template literals make string with multiple lines easier.
