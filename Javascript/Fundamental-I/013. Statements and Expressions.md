# Statement and Expressions

## Expression

It is a piece of code that produces a value.

e.g.: 3+4 ,1991, true && false etc.

## Statement

Piece of code that is executed and that does not produces value on its own. They are also known as declarations.

e.g.: if/else statement.

> **NOTE**: The distinction between expressions and statements is important to know since javascript expects expressions ans statement in certain part of code. <br/>
> e.g.: <code>console.log(`This is ${2033-10}`)//output: This is 2023</code><br/>
> Here, the expression inside string literal produces a value which javascript would return as an output.
