# Control structure and conditional statements

if/else statements takes decisions based on the boolean value passed.

e.g.: <code>let age=20<br/> if(age>=18){
<br/>console.log("Old enough to get driving license")
</br>}<br/> else{
<br/>console.log("Need to be 18 year+")<br/>} </code>

> There is also else-if statement which helps in taking more conditions.
