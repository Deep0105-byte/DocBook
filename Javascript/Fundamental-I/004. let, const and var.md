# let, const and var

This are the 3 different ways to declare the variable. let and const are introduced in ES6 and are modern while var is the old way to declare the variable.

---
## let

It allows reassignment or mutation of a variable even if variable is only initialized.

## const

It used for the variables which are not supposed to change in the future. In short, it used to create immutable variables.

Also, we cannot declare empty variable i.e., const variables cannot be initialized they must be declared during their initialization.

> Best practice of clean code to always declare a variable using **const** if you're sure that variable is not gonna be change in the future. It is due to that is good to have little variable mutations as possible since it can cause bugs in program or application.

## var

It is old way to declare a variable prior to ES6, and should be avoided. On surface level, it looks that it works like let but under the surface it works differently.

### Declaring a variable without let or const

e.g.: <code>name="John"<br>//output: "John"</code>

As witnessed above javascript allows to declare variable without using let or const and javascript even happily execute that but this is a terrible way since instead of creating on any scope it create is as a property on global object.

> So, never write variable without declaring it with **let** or **const**
