# Functional Programming

Functional programming is one of the two important programming paradigm used in javascript. Other is object-oriented programming.

**Before deep diving into functional programming in javascript let's see a brief history of functional programming**

    So, functional programming is a very old programming paradigm. Lisp is one of the earliest programming language to implement this paradigm. The idea of functional programming originates from Mathematics. In recent years it becomes very popular paradigm like in Redux, React and also languages like Haskell, Scala,etc. It works very well with distributed computing like parallelism and multiple machine interactions.

## What it is?

It is all about separating the code into chunks like we do in object oriented programming. In object oriented we separate fields and methods but in functional programming we also separate data. They emphasize on simplicity and data. They don't have the concept of classes and objects, rather they have well defined data structures and reusable functions.

### Goals

1. Keep code clear and understandable
2. Easy to extend
3. Maintainable
4. Memory Efficient
5. DRY principle

> Unlike in object-oriented programming where it has 4 pillars, if we break down the the pillar in functional programming it is only one i.e., **Pure functions**

> All objects created in functional programming are immutable. We avoid shared state.
