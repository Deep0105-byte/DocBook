# Compose

Composing or composition is the idea that any data transformation we do should be obvious.

It is a system design principle which is deals with the relationship between components.The components can be selected and assembled in various combinations.

Let's look at the example of multiplying two numbers and making them absolute.

e.g.: <code>

const compose=(x,y)=>(data)=>x(y(data));

const multiplyBy5=(a)=>a\*5;

const makeAbsolute=(a)=>Math.abs(a);

const multiplyBy5andAbsolute=compose(multiplyBy5,makeAbsolute)

multiplyBy5andAbsolute(-8) //output: 40

</code>

The compose function is not built-in in javascript but many libraries like Ramda,etc provides the inbuilt compose function to select and assemble the components.

The compose function in the above example takes two functions as arguments and a parameter and pass it to the function arguments.

# Pipe

Pipe is like compose but order is reverse in pipe contrast to compose i.e., instead of going from right to left it goes from left to right.

e.g.: <code>

const compose=(x,y)=>(data)=>x(y(data));

const pipe=(x,y)=>(data)=>y(x(data));

const multiplyBy5=(a)=>a\*5;

const makeAbsolute=(a)=>Math.abs(a);

const multiplyBy5andAbsolute=compose(multiplyBy5,makeAbsolute)

multiplyBy5andAbsolute(-8) //output: 40

</code>

Unlike in compose where makeAbsolute function first acts then multiplyBy5, here multiplyBy5 acts first then makeAbsolute acts i.e., left to right.
